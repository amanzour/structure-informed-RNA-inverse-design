# checkpoints

Two checkpoints are available for sequence design purposes.
SIRD_ARv1_3state_seqid.h5         | trained on seqid training set. Has 4 layers.
SIRD_ARv1_3state_seqid_soloRNA.h5 | trained on seqid training set only including solo RNAs and RNA-DNA Hybrids. Has 4 layers.

For instructions on how to perform design using either of the above parameters, see README.md in the main directory.
